      "The road bends off to the left. A trained eye or a detailed map would reveal the overgrown road straight ahead, covered in hastily grown shrubs and small trees. Part of this is forest is craft and part (the larger trees) are illusions. The new road leads to a small grove with three small houses of loggers with a tiny farm. Three families live there, the wives of which are all hags, the husbands are brainwashed commoners, one of the daughters is quite the powerful witch in training. The hags need fresh blood and the trick with the road is their way to get victims."
