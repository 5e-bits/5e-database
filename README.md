# How to run

## With Docker
You should be able to build locally and then run the local Docker image.

## Without Docker
First you need to make sure you have [MongoDB installed locally.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

You can load this data locally by running:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/5e-database npm run db:refresh
```
